            I am currently developing an Unreal Engine 4 plugin that helps developers connect with Discord to easily
            update the players' presence from within the game.<br/>
            Internally I use the Discord GameSDK. This also allows the plugin to implement the request to join, join
            and spectate events that get called from the Discord client.
