                P.A.I.N.T. is an online cooperative third-person shooter where you join the P.U.N.K.S.
                The P.U.N.K.S are a bunch of rebels that hang around in their ultimate hideout. They despise order and structure thus try to correct the world with their paint blasters.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is just one thing standing in their way, the sinister S.U.I.T.S. corporation. They manufacture their mundane suits in their massive grim factory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Together with the P.U.N.K.S. you forge a plan to invade the S.U.I.T.S. factory. You penetrate the factory door with your badass minivan and armed with your paint blaster you cover the environment in bright colours.

                    During the project I have worked on optimizing the game and networking performance.<br/>
                    For most of the performance issues I started with profiling the point in the game where the issue lies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the networking performance issues, I used the Unreal network profiler to find the places in our
                    game that cause the network issues. From the profiling I found various issues in the game regarding
                    our networking and focused on fixing these issues from the places that had the biggest impact to the
                    lower ones. After optimizing our network performance, we saw a huge improvement in-game and this
                    reflected back in the network profiler data.
                    From improving the network performance I also learned more best-practices regarding networking in Unreal.

                <p>
                    During the development of our game, I worked on various gameplay elements of the game.<br/>
                    One of these gameplay aspects is the Player. I implemented the player movement and dashing
                    functionality according to the design specifications. I implemented various visual and audio effects
                    to the player and I massively improved the player code structure. Some of the player functionality
                    also required to be replicate across the multiplayer session and I also integrated this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also worked on the functionality of the weapons. I worked on the weapons system with shooting,
                    aiming, reloading and any other effects that were required by the design specification. I also
                    implemented the networking aspects of the weapon. For example I implemented the networking side of
                    the shooting of the weapon, making sure the server has authority over what the client does, without
                    having a negative impact on the client. The reloading also needed to be networked properly as the
                    server has authority over the amount of ammo for example, and other players should see and hear the
                    reloading effects on that player in their game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another system I worked on is the pickups system. The pickups system I developed has functionality
                    so the pickup only works for 1 player, so every player can pick it up, or one of the player can pick
                    it up. This was according to the design specifications of the pickups we designed for the game.
                    Unfortunately in the final product we only used the health pickup as a pickup in the game.

                    To simplify the release and Steam versioning workflow, I developed another tool in the Discord
                    bot. The Steam versioning tool has the following features:

                    I integrated Steam rich presence into our game. Unreal still used outdated parts of the Steam SDK
                    that make the rich presence work. This meant I went through the Steam SDK and the Unreal Engine source
                    to find the current implementation, how it's supposed to work and make changes to the Unreal Engine
                    source code to update the Unreal Steam Rich presence to use the features of the latest SDK.
                    In-game we now show what the player is doing in the level and with how many people they are playing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have also integrated Discord rich presence into our game. Unlike Steam rich presence, there was no
                    support for Discord functionality in the Unreal Engine. I developed a Unreal plugin that implements
                    Discord's game SDK features into Unreal. Currently in our game we use this to update the player's
                    status to show what they are doing in-game and with how many people they are playing.

                    As a partly coop game, I investigated other ways of implementing split-screen.
                    I researched some different split-screen implementations to find the best functioning and performing
                    option.
                    The different types of split-screen I researched are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Voronoi split-screen</li>

                    <li>Simple split-screen</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately due to time constraints and performance reasons, split-screen did not end up in the
                    final product.
